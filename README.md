# Relative Music Theory (RMT) App

A revolutionary approach to musical notation and composition based on rational number relationships.

## Overview

The Relative Music Theory (RMT) App is a proof-of-concept implementation of a new system for representing and manipulating musical notes and structures. Unlike traditional music notation systems constrained by the 12-tone equal temperament, RMT allows for precise representation of any frequency relationship, enabling composers and musicians to work with perfect intervals, explore new harmonic possibilities, and transcribe music from diverse tuning systems around the world.

Key features:
- Represent notes as mathematical relationships rather than fixed frequencies
- Work with perfect intervals and ratios beyond the limitations of 12-tone equal temperament
- Easily transpose and manipulate musical structures 
- Explore microtonal and alternative tuning systems
- Visualize complex harmonic relationships

## Technology

The RMT App is built using:

- [Tapspace.js](https://github.com/taataa/tapspace) - A zoomable user interface library that provides the infinite, scalable canvas for visualizing musical structures
- [Fraction.js](https://github.com/rawify/Fraction.js) - A rational number library that enables precise mathematical representation and manipulation of frequency ratios

## Current Status

This app is an early proof-of-concept to demonstrate the core ideas behind Relative Music Theory. While functional, it is not yet optimized for performance or designed for production use. Development will be transferred to a more robust, full-featured application in the future.

## Potential Applications

The RMT system has wide-ranging potential applications in music technology:

1. Advanced composition tools allowing for microtonal and non-standard tunings
2. Music education software for teaching advanced harmony concepts
3. Ethnomusicology tools for accurately transcribing and analyzing music from diverse cultures  
4. New digital instruments and synthesizers based on rational frequency relationships
5. AI/ML systems for music generation and analysis using a more flexible tonal framework

## Future Development

We are seeking investment and collaboration opportunities to develop RMT into a comprehensive suite of next-generation music software tools. The underlying mathematical approach has the potential to revolutionize how we create, analyze, and interact with music in the digital realm.
