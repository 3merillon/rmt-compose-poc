## What is RMT Compose?

RMT Compose is a **production-ready music composition tool** built around **relative music theory** - the idea that musical relationships (intervals, chords, rhythms) can be expressed as exact mathematical ratios rather than fixed pitches.

Instead of saying "this note is 440Hz", you say "this note is 3/2 times the base frequency". This approach:

- **Preserves pure harmonic relationships** from the natural overtone series
- **Makes transposition trivial** - change the base note and everything shifts proportionally
- **Enables exploration** of alternative tuning systems like 19-TET or Bohlen-Pierce

## Quick Example

A major chord in just intonation:

| Note | Ratio | Interval |
|------|-------|----------|
| Root | 1/1 | Unison |
| Third | 5/4 | Major third |
| Fifth | 3/2 | Perfect fifth |

In RMT Compose, you write frequency expressions like:

```javascript
// Major third above base note
module.baseNote.getVariable('frequency').mul(new Fraction(5, 4))

// Perfect fifth above base note
module.baseNote.getVariable('frequency').mul(new Fraction(3, 2))
```

## Who is this for?

- **Musicians and composers** exploring just intonation and microtonal music
- **Music theorists** studying interval relationships mathematically
- **Developers** interested in music DSLs, bytecode compilation, and WebGL rendering
- **Educators** teaching acoustics and the physics of harmony
