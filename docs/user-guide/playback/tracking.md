# Playhead Tracking

**Playhead tracking** automatically scrolls the workspace to keep the playhead centered during playback.

## Enabling Tracking

1. Find the **Tracking toggle** in the top bar
2. Click to enable (toggle becomes highlighted)
3. The workspace will now follow the playhead

## How It Works

When tracking is enabled:
- The workspace scrolls horizontally as the playhead moves
- The playhead stays near the center of the view
- You can see upcoming notes before they play

When tracking is disabled:
- The workspace stays fixed
- The playhead moves across the static view
- You must manually pan to see different parts

## When to Use Tracking

### Enable tracking when:

- Your composition is longer than one screen width
- You want to follow along during playback
- You're reviewing a piece from start to finish
- You're presenting or demonstrating a composition

### Disable tracking when:

- You want to watch a specific section repeatedly
- You're editing while partially playing
- Your composition fits on one screen
- You want to manually control the view

## Interaction with Other Controls
