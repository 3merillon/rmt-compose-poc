# Playhead Tracking

**Playhead tracking** automatically scrolls the workspace to keep the playhead centered during playback.

## Enabling Tracking

1. Find the **Tracking toggle** in the top bar
2. Click to enable (toggle becomes highlighted)
3. The workspace will now follow the playhead

## How It Works

When tracking is enabled:
- The workspace scrolls horizontally as the playhead moves
- The playhead stays near the center of the view
- You can see upcoming notes before they play

When tracking is disabled:
- The workspace stays fixed
- The playhead moves across the static view
- You must manually pan to see different parts

## When to Use Tracking

### Enable tracking when:

- Your composition is longer than one screen width
- You want to follow along during playback
- You're reviewing a piece from start to finish
- You're presenting or demonstrating a composition

### Disable tracking when:

- You want to watch a specific section repeatedly
- You're editing while partially playing
- Your composition fits on one screen
- You want to manually control the view

## Interaction with Other Controls

### Reset View Button

When tracking is enabled:
- The **Reset View** button is disabled
- Tracking controls the view automatically
- Disable tracking to use Reset View

### Pan and Zoom

When tracking is enabled:
- Horizontal panning is overridden during playback (vertical panning still works)
- Zooming still works
- When playback stops, your last manual position is restored

### Stop Button

When you click Stop:
- Playback stops
- The playhead resets to the beginning (time = 0)
- Tracking remains enabled for the next play

## Tips

1. **Disable while editing** - Turn off tracking when making changes to notes
2. **Enable for full playback** - Turn on tracking when listening through an entire composition
3. **Use vertical pan** - You can still pan vertically to see different frequency ranges while tracking
4. **Toggle mid-playback** - You can turn tracking on or off during playback without stopping
