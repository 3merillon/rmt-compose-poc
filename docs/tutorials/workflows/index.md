# Workflow Tutorials

Practical guides for common tasks and experimentation.

## In This Section

### [Creating a Module Library](./module-library)
Build, organize, and maintain a personal library of reusable modules. Learn best practices for naming, categorizing, and designing modules for reuse.

### [Interval Exploration](./intervals)
A systematic workflow for understanding and experimenting with musical intervals. Includes comparison charts, exercises, and methods for building your ear.

### [Microtonal Experiments](./microtonal-experiments)
Practical experiments for exploring microtonal tuning systems. Discover new sounds through structured comparison and experimentation.

## What Are Workflow Tutorials?

Unlike concept-focused tutorials, workflow tutorials guide you through complete tasks from start to finish. They're designed to help you:
- Accomplish specific goals efficiently
- Develop good habits and practices
- Build lasting resources (like a module library)
- Learn through hands-on experimentation

## Prerequisites

These workflows assume familiarity with:
- Basic note creation and editing
- Expression syntax
- The Module Bar and file operations

For specific workflows, see individual prerequisites in each tutorial.

## Recommended Use

### Building Your Library
Start with [Module Library](./module-library) to set up your organizational structure. Then use the other workflows to populate it with useful content.

### Learning Tuning Theory
Follow [Interval Exploration](./intervals) to systematically study intervals, then apply that knowledge in [Microtonal Experiments](./microtonal-experiments).

### Quick Reference
Return to these tutorials when you need to remember specific procedures or want templates for common tasks.

## Workflow Patterns

Common patterns you'll learn:
- **A/B Comparison**: Creating side-by-side comparisons for ear training
- **Template Design**: Building reusable starting points
- **Systematic Exploration**: Methodically covering a topic
- **Documentation**: Recording discoveries for future reference

## Next Steps

After working through these tutorials:
- Apply techniques to your own compositions
- Share interesting modules with others
- Explore the [Developer Documentation](/developer/) if you want to understand the technical details
