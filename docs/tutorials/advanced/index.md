# Advanced Tutorials

Deep dives into powerful features for experienced users.

## In This Section

### [Microtonal Composition](./microtonal)
Explore music beyond the standard 12-note scale. Learn to work with alternative equal temperaments (19-TET, 31-TET), just intonation, and the Bohlen-Pierce scale.

### [SymbolicPower Algebra](./symbolic-power)
Understand how RMT Compose handles irrational numbers like 2^(1/12) with full algebraic precision. Learn why this matters for accurate tuning and how to leverage it.

### [Complex Dependencies](./complex-dependencies)
Master advanced dependency patterns including multi-property dependencies, branching structures, diamond dependencies, and tempo hierarchies.

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, you should be comfortable with:
- [Dependencies](/tutorials/intermediate/dependencies) - Basic note chaining
- [Octaves](/tutorials/intermediate/octaves) - Frequency manipulation
- [Measures](/tutorials/intermediate/measures) - Tempo and timing

## What You'll Learn

After completing these tutorials, you'll be able to:
- Create microtonal compositions using various tuning systems
- Understand the algebraic precision behind TET calculations
- Build sophisticated dependency hierarchies
- Design reusable templates with complex relationships
- Debug and trace dependency chains

## Recommended Order

1. **Microtonal** - Opens up new sonic territory
2. **SymbolicPower** - Understand the math behind the magic
3. **Complex Dependencies** - Build intricate compositions

## Technical Depth

These tutorials explain not just *how* to use features, but *why* they work the way they do. You'll gain insight into:
- Why pure ratios sound different from tempered intervals
- How SymbolicPower preserves algebraic exactness
- The efficiency of the dependency graph system
