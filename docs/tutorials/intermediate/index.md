# Intermediate Tutorials

Build on the basics with more advanced techniques.

## In This Section

### [Chaining Notes with Dependencies](./dependencies)
Learn how to create musical relationships between notes using expressions that reference other notes. Build dynamic compositions where changes cascade through your music.

### [Working with Octaves](./octaves)
Master octave manipulation using frequency ratios and the power operation. Learn techniques for building octave-spanning chords and bringing notes into comfortable ranges.

### [Measure-Based Timing](./measures)
Work with tempo, beats, and measures to create rhythmically structured compositions. Learn the formulas for converting between beats and seconds.

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, make sure you've completed:
- [Your First Composition](/getting-started/first-composition) - Basic note creation
- [Core Concepts](/getting-started/concepts) - Understanding ratios and expressions
- [Beginner Tutorials](/tutorials/beginner/) - Scales, chords, and melody basics

## What You'll Learn

After completing these tutorials, you'll be able to:
- Create notes that automatically update when their dependencies change
- Transpose entire sections by changing a single root note
- Build octave-spanning voicings and arpeggios
- Structure compositions using tempo and measure relationships
- Chain timing so notes play in sequence

## Recommended Order

1. **Dependencies** - Foundation for all relational composition
2. **Octaves** - Frequency manipulation basics
3. **Measures** - Rhythmic structure and tempo

## Next Steps

After mastering these concepts, continue to:
- [Advanced Tutorials](/tutorials/advanced/) - Microtonal composition, SymbolicPower, complex dependencies
